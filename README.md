# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos

Aerospace engineer and technologist focused on **AI, space, and open source**.

I currently work in **technology at Inditex**, where I **design and lead internal products** that **enable and scale the company’s open source strategy** in a global, enterprise environment. My work focuses on **turning internal innovation into open, sustainable projects**, defining how they are released to the community with the right **governance, adoption, impact, and external collaboration**.

Previously, I was a **co-founder of NUWE, a tech startup**, where I built **AI-driven products**, led **go-to-market and international expansion**, closed **enterprise deals**, helped raise **~€1.3M**, and scaled teams to **15+ people**.  
I also have hands-on experience in **AI for autonomous drones**, working on **motion estimation, SLAM, and sensor fusion (vision + IMU)** for robotic systems.

## 🧭 Areas of Focus

- 🌍 **Open Source**  
  Internal platforms, governance models, and strategies to release internal projects to the community.

- 🧠 **AI & Robotics**  
  Computer Vision, ML/DL, **SLAM, UAVs, autonomy, and sensor fusion**.

- 🛰️ **Engineering**  
  Aerial robotics, autonomous systems, ROS, C++ / Python.

- 💼 **Product**  
  Strategy, adoption, impact, and execution in complex environments.

## 🌱 Vision

I’m interested in building **invisible but essential infrastructure**: tools, rules, and cultures that help developers create better systems, collaborate more effectively, and leave healthier ecosystems behind.
